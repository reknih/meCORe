##Description
meCORe is the open source basement of meTAPower, a Windows Store App to view your pictures and their geo-metadata, with the goal to provide rock-solid code.
Right now, work is focusing on implementing a IndexedDB database to cache the image objects and save the users' settings.

##Installation
After you downloaded all the files here you can open the `.jsproj`-File in Visual Studio 2012 on Windows 8. Then you can compile and run the app from there.
